### Task B: Find the Spot

**Task:** Develop a mapping (walking) application to find a specific set location in a large warehouse store for a customer. The customer can move north, south, east, or west.

**Hints:** Loops, Variables

# ------------------------------------------------- #

START

1. Define the warehouse layout as a 2D grid (rows x columns).

2. Set the customer's starting position:
   Set start_position = (x_start, y_start)

3. Define the target position (where the item is located):
   Set target_position = (x_target, y_target)

4. Initialize the customer's current position as the starting position:
   Set current_position = start_position

5. WHILE current_position is not equal to target_position:
   
   a. Display "Current position: (x_current, y_current)"
   
   b. Prompt the customer to input a direction: 'north', 'south', 'east', or 'west'
   
   c. Update the current position based on the customer's input:
   
      IF input is 'north' AND current_position_y > 0:
         Move north (current_position_y = current_position_y - 1)
      
      ELSE IF input is 'south' AND current_position_y < max_rows - 1:
         Move south (current_position_y = current_position_y + 1)
      
      ELSE IF input is 'east' AND current_position_x < max_columns - 1:
         Move east (current_position_x = current_position_x + 1)
      
      ELSE IF input is 'west' AND current_position_x > 0:
         Move west (current_position_x = current_position_x - 1)
      
      ELSE:
         Display "Invalid move! Try again."

6. END WHILE

7. Once current_position == target_position:
   Display "You have reached your destination!"

END

Key Points:
• Warehouse as Grid: The store is a 2D grid where the customer can navigate.
• Movement Directions: The customer can move north, south, east, or west within the grid, with boundary checks.
• Loop Until Reaching Destination: The customer continues moving until they reach the target location.
• Boundaries: Boundary checks ensure the customer doesn't move outside the grid.
This simple version focuses on the core functionality of navigating to a target location based on user input.
