### Task C: Product Package Counter

**Task:** You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

**Hint:** Loops

# ------------------------------------------------- #

START

1. Initialize a variable 'package_count' to 2.

2. WHILE package_count <= 50:
   
   a. Print 'package_count'
   
   b. Increment 'package_count' by 2.

END

Explanation:
• Initialize package_count: Start counting from 2 because each scan represents 2 products.
• Loop Condition: Continue the loop until package_count reaches or exceeds 50.
• Print: In each iteration, print the current package_count.
• Increment: After each print, increase package_count by 2 to simulate scanning the next set of 2 products.

This pseudocode prints the numbers 2, 4, 6, ... up to 50, representing the count of packages scanned.
